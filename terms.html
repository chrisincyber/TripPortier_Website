        <ul>

            <li>Forward booking confirmation emails (flights, hotels, restaurants, activities) to this address</li>
            <li>AI analyzes the email content and attachments to extract booking details</li>
            <li>Extracted bookings appear in your app for review and approval before being added to your trips</li>
        </ul>

            <li>PDF attachments from emails are stored securely in Firebase Storage for attachment to your itinerary items</li>

            <li>Original emails are not permanently stored after processing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>11.3 Data Accuracy</h3>

        <h2>17. Severability</h2>
