        <ul>

            <li>Forward booking confirmation emails (flights, hotels, restaurants, activities) to this address</li>
            <li>AI analyzes the email content and attachments to extract booking details</li>
            <li>Extracted bookings appear in your app for review and approval before being added to your trips</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>11.2 Email Processing</h3>

            <li>Emails you forward are received and processed by our secure email service (Amazon SES)</li>

            <li>Extracted data includes: booking type, confirmation numbers, dates, times, locations, prices, and provider details</li>
            <li>PDF attachments from emails are stored securely in Firebase Storage for attachment to your itinerary items</li>

            <li>Original emails are not permanently stored after processing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>11.3 Data Accuracy</h3>
        <p>AI extraction may not be 100% accurate:</p>

            <li>You can edit any extracted fields (title, dates, times, locations) before confirmation</li>
            <li>We display a confidence indicator to help you gauge extraction reliability</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for errors in AI-extracted booking information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>17. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
